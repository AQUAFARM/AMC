!! Introduction

Flickr Schedulr is a Windows desktop application that automatically uploads pictures and videos to [url:Flickr|http://www.flickr.com] based on a schedule (e.g. to post a new picture every day at a certain time). This effectively takes the hassle of uploading pictures and videos at regular intervals away, and allows you to go out and have fun shooting pictures (or drinking beer) while your photoblog is maintained for you.

Of course, you don't _have_ to schedule your uploads, it's also a fine stand-alone Flickr upload tool as it is. It allows you to create a queue of files to be uploaded, along with their titles, descriptions, tags, photosets and groups into which they should end up, and lots of other details. You can group them into batches that should be uploaded together. And a flexible plugin mechanism adds tons of other functionality - like automatically importing metadata, determining photosets and groups, monitoring folders for new files, and modifying pictures or videos before they are uploaded (e.g. to resize, add watermarks or borders).

For more details on how it works, see the [Documentation] page.

* v3.1 (June 28th, 2011)
** The "Import Metadata" plugin can now add lots of additional details (like exposure time, aperture, ISO, ...) to a picture's description in a configurable way.
** Added a "Delay" plugin that you can use to wait for a number of seconds before running the next action in the list.
** The expanded/collapsed state is now remembered for events as well.
** Fixed an important issue that always caused the application to crash after uploading a selection of files.
** Fixed an important issue that could cause the application to crash when files were added from monitored folders.
* v3.0 (May 12, 2011)
** You can now configure a new photoset to be created for a batch when it is uploaded.
** Added support for plugins that can perform actions when certain events happen in the application.
** Many new features are now available as plugins that come with the application:
*** Backing up the configuration.
*** Importing metadata when new files are added to the queue.
*** Deleting or moving files after they are uploaded.
*** Automatically determining photosets and groups when new files are added to the queue based on the folder they're in.
*** Monitoring folders for new files and optionally placing them in separate batches per folder they're in.
*** Running arbitrary programs on any event.
*** Modifying a picture or video before it is uploaded (adding borders, converting to black & white, cropping, resizing, adding watermarks).

** The expanded/collapsed state is now remembered for batches as well.
** Upgraded to new versions of the TaskScheduler library and GMap.NET mapping library.
* v2.4 (January 25, 2011)

** Fixed issue that editing multiple pictures wouldn't always work well when changing the selection.

** The usability of the editing area has been improved: sets and groups are now defined separately and the different parts of the window can be resized with splitter bars.
** Previously uploaded pictures can be added to the queue again.
* v1.2 (December 4, 2007)
** You can now choose Groups and multiple Photosets to associate your pictures with.
** I'm also releasing the source code from now on (built on .NET 2.0 with Visual Studio 2008).
** I've set up a dedicated [url:Schedulr Group on Flickr|http://www.flickr.com/groups/schedulr], a community site where you can ask questions, give comments, complain about bugs (what, bugs?!) and post pictures - uploaded with Schedulr of course!
