!! Command Line Options

You can use the following command line options:

{{ Schedulr [/account:name] [/upload] [/add | /addbatch] [file1 file2...] }}

* /account: the name of the Flickr account to use (to upload or add files to); if this is not specified, the default account will be used.
* /upload will upload the next batch of files from the specified account to Flickr.
* /add will add the specified files to the queue of the specified account as individual batches (one batch per file).
* /addbatch will add the specified files to the queue of the specified account as one single batch.
* file1 file2...: the file(s) to add to the queue of the specified account.
None of these arguments are required, and if you only pass in a list of files they will simply be added as individual batches to the queue of the default account.
